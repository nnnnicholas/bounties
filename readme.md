# Bounties 

Permissionless bounties for content creators. This contract lets you collect donations pointing at user defined strings. 

<!-- ## Mechanism
Leaderboard allows EVM wallets to *draw attention* to a given address. 

Example scenario:

- ilemi deploys a Leaderboard to Ethereum Mainnet. He is the contract owner. **He announces that he will do a Dune Dash and Twitter thread about any address that receives 1 ETH of attention.**
- I, an enthusiast of a certain NFT collection or DAO, call `payAttention(address contract)` and send 0.1 ETH in the same transaction. I encourage nine of my closest friends to do the same. I ping ilemi on twitter when it is done and mention the contract address I want him to look into.
- ilemi calls `retrieveAttention(address contract)` and confirms that this address *has* received 1 ETH worth of attention. As the owner, he may `withdraw()` the contract's balance to his wallet, or he may `withdrawTo(address to, uint amount)` a portion of the contract's balance to any address.

## Extra features
- Owner may `resetAttention(address contract)` which sets that contract's attention counter to 0.
- Owner may pause `payAttention()` so that no one may pay attention to any address.
- Anyone can call `totalAttention()` to see total attention paid (ETH).

## Deploy instructions

## Origins story
[ilemi.eth](https://twitter.com/andrewhong5297)'s Dune Analytics dashboards and Twitter threads came to my attention in November 2021 in the wake of ConstitutionDAO, for which he created [an excellent dash](https://dune.xyz/ilemi/ConstitutionDAO-Funding-Tracker). It occurred to me that ilemi could charge people for the quantitative analysis he provides. Leaderboard is the system I created to help people like ilemi permissionlessly monetize their attention.
